## About
Anywhere Fitness helps people register for and attend organized workout classes without having to sign up for a gym. 
- Instructors have the ability to create, edit or delete classes they plan to host.
- Client/general users can view all available classes and register to take a class.

## Motivation
This project began as a group project and has since been re-written/re-developed to more closely align with a new direction for the app.
The goal for this app is to become a one-stop-shop for all of your workout needs. Whether you want to find different instructor lead
workout classes, or you want to manage your past workouts and keep track of your progress, you can do all of this in the Anywhere Fitness app.

## Tech Used
